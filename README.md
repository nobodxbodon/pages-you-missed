All the links on all the pages you visited are saved to LOCAL storage
within browser (IndexedDB).
Links are saved after whole page is loaded or partial page is updated.

You can open the option page to search in the saved links by title
from Chrome 'Settings' -> 'Extensions'. I choose to put it there as I
don't want to add any additional UI element.

Searching is naive, by exact word matching (case insensitive), and
doesn't support searching in languages that don't use space as
delimiter.
